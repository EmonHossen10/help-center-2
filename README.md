1.How can you implement shared functionality across a component tree?

answer:To implement shared functionality across a component tree, you can use several approaches depending on the framework or library you're working with. In React, for instance, one effective method is to use Context API. This involves creating a Context object that holds the shared state or functionality, and then providing this Context at a high level in the component tree. Components that need access to the shared functionality can consume this Context, either using the `useContext` hook or the `Context.Consumer` component. Another approach is to use higher-order components (HOCs) or custom hooks to encapsulate and share functionality. HOCs wrap components to provide additional props or functionality, while custom hooks allow you to extract and reuse logic across multiple components. Additionally, in state management libraries like Redux, you can define actions and reducers that manage shared state, and connect components to this global state using the library's provided APIs. Each of these methods helps ensure that shared functionality is consistent and easily accessible throughout your component tree.

2.Why is the useState hook appropriate for handling state in a complex component?

answer:The `useState` hook is well-suited for handling state in a complex component because it provides a simple and intuitive way to manage local state within functional components. Unlike class components, where state management involves class methods and lifecycle management, `useState` allows you to declare state variables and update them directly within functional components. This makes it easier to manage and reason about state, especially when dealing with multiple pieces of state or when state changes frequently. The hook's ability to encapsulate state logic within the component and its integration with other hooks, like `useEffect`, enables developers to build complex components while keeping the state management clean and organized.
